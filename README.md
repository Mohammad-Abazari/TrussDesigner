Generates a graphical and mathematical model of a 2d truss. Functions for adding/removing/moving truss joints and beams assist the user in optimizing the the truss. Additionally, a specification-checking function ensures that the truss meets inputted standards. Forces in beams are calculated using static equilibrium equations and applying linear algebra techniques to solve.
